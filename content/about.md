I am an Engineering Science student at University of Toronto specializing in math, statisics and finances.

I am currently on a Professional Experience Year (PEY) at Honda of Canada as a data anaylst intern. I am applying the statistic knowledge that I have learned, to predict and derive insights from data. My journey through working with data, both through my education and work experience, has fueled my passion for data, ranging from data engineering to analysis.

Feel free to explore my [skills](/skills/) page where I list all my technical skills, and my [projects](/projects/) to showcase and apply my technical skills to a real life sitaution.
