# Purpose
Creating a personal website has allowed me to have a dedicated space to showcase my works.

# Build Process
## Static Site Generation
Using Hugo, a static site generator, I created a static page made of collection of documents. Using Hugo has ensured a quick creation as well as hosting of the site.

I am using the PaperMod theme, as I liked its minimalistic looks.

## Hosting on netfliy
Netfliy hosts the site and automatically rebuilds and updates the site whenever changes are pushed onto the [github repository](https://github.com/ricebiceps/parkweb).

# What's next?
I'll be uploading new projects as well as updating my information on this website. I also have plans to make this site dynamic.
